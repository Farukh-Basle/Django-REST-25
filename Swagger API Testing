To work with django rest swagger api testing concepts then we required like

Prerequisites: Python 2.7, 3.5 or 3.6, Django 1.8+, Django REST framework 3.5.1+


Step 1 :  Install django-rest-swagger package:

cmd> pip install django-rest-swagger


Step 2: Add rest_framework_swagger to INSTALLED_APPS inside your settings:


INSTALLED_APPS = [
    '---------',
    '---------',
    'rest_framework',

    'rest_framework_swagger',  # Add this one
    ...
]



Step 3:  For a quick start, use shortcut method get_swagger_view which will generate          Swagger UI documentation for your API. This method have two optional parameters          title (of your Swagger documentation) and url (to your Swagger documentation).          You need to add to your URL configuration the following code:


--->> open urls.py file and add the code like

from rest_framework_swagger.views import get_swagger_view

schema_view = get_swagger_view(title=' Swagger API for Employee')


from rest_framework.documentation import include_docs_urls

swagger_documentation = include_docs_urls(
                title='Swagger API Documentation for Employee')


urlpatterns = [
    ...
    url(r^swagger_api/', schema_view), # add this line
    url(r'^swagger_docs/', swagger_documentation),
    ...
]



Note:
====
If you want to provide documentsation for your API, django REST Framework provide
a support  for that  Django REST Swagger  used for generating well Known
swagger documentation

get_swagger_view() :
================
is a method, witch will generate  Swagger UI documentation for your API.

This method have two optional parameters.

1) title (of your Swagger documentation) and
2) url (to your Swagger documentation.)

You can customize configuration for your Swagger docs  by defining
"SWAGGER_SETTINGS"  dictionary in your settings.

for example, you can display request headers and list HTTP requests that
allow interacting with them
 (only supported methods will have "Try it out" button.)


SWAGGER_SETTINGS = {
     'SUPPORTED_SUBMIT_METHODS' : [ 'get' , 'post', ] ,
     'USE_SESSION_AUTH' : True ,
}


If it is also possible to provide customised configuration for your
authentication mechanism.

For instance ,  if you don't want to use Django authentication system
for swagger docs , set USE_SESSION_AUTH to  False  value.

If we do like this there will not be a  Django Login button  on the top of
your docs.


Definitions
==========
Django Rest Swagger is used to provide Documentation for all API's
which are used in your application with brief description
about each API individually.
It is Open Source so you can contribute to the project.

What is Swagger?
************
Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification
that can help us to design, build, document and consume REST APIs.


 The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all
  awesomeness in Swagger. Note that Swagger not only helps us to design
  and document REST APIs, it also lets us build (Server Stub) and
  Consume (Rest Clients) REST APIs.


=========    ============

 Django Rest Framework 3.10 (released a few days ago) deprecated the
  CoreAPI based schema generation, and introduced the OpenAPI schema
 generation in its place. Currently to continue to use django-rest-swagger
 as is you need to re-enable the CoreAPI schema generation by adding
  the following config to the settings file:


REST_FRAMEWORK = {
     'DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS': 'rest_framework.schemas.coreapi.AutoSchema'
}


Note: otherwise we will get like bellow.
=================
AttributeError: 'AutoSchema' object has no attribute 'get_link'




Continuing to use CoreAPI
=======================
If you're currently using the CoreAPI schemas, you'll need to make sure to
update your REST framework settings to include DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS explicitly.

settings.py:

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
  ...
  'DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS': 'rest_framework.schemas.coreapi.AutoSchema'
}
